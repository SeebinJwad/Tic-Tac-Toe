THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CHECKING OUT TICTACTOE
BY JAWAD KAZI :D
HAVE FUN WITH THE CODE
TO DO:

***** CREATE THE WHOLE CODE BUT AS PSEUDO-CODE FIRST *****

1) TURN THE FOR LOOP FOR EACH MOVE INTO A SERIES OF IF STATEMENTS

2) RUN A DRAW-BOARD FUNCTION MAKE IT JUST LOOK OK FIRST THEN WORK ON DESIGN LATER
    a) IDEALLY MAKE IT A RED AND BLUE SLIGHTLY TRANSPARENT

3) IF YOU PRESS A SPOT THAT IS ON THE BOARD AND IS NOT TAKEN BY OPPONENT THING
    a) IF THERE ARE NO MORE MOVES LEFT THEN TIE THE GAME

4) MAKE SURE FUNCTIONALITY WORKS AND THEN WORK ON FUN POWER-UPS

Other Notes:
in the main function run a function that waits for input in one of the spaces
While area that is open has not been selected, continue
Once one of the spaces is clicked on, then continue on as usual
Create a part where at the beginning of the game you have the ability to using a special ability
That special ability is like flipping the board or flipping the pieces so you are now black or white
You choose in that move to use the letter or not
The fun of it is clicking on the button to change something as soon as someone as presses their selected letter
The fun part is that you can determine what the key is to activate the certain key
For instance, if someone wants to flip the board they can choose that option and bind it to A
Towards the end of the game they decide to press the X button and act like its A button to have opponent react
Even more fun is that the key-binding must be a letter that is either (pick like 10 letters)
The fun is going fast
One ability may be to only give opponent 3 seconds to make their move after you
